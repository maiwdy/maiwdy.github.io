<p>I am a computer science student attending the University of Québec At Montréal (UQÀM). I am currently aiming to become a software engineer or a security engineer, or both ... don't know yet. Still learning the basics of code from HTML/CSS (also a little of JavaScript) to Java passing by Python and C++ (almost nothing for this one, only the famous "Hello World"). Also trying to learn other stuff like video editing, graphic design, psychology and sociology. That's all for now.
