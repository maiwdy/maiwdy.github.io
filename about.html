<p>I am a computer science student attending the University of Montreal. I am currently aiming to become a software engineer or a security engineer, or both. Still learning the basics of code from HTML/CSS to C++ passing by Python and Java. Trying to maybe become a Full-Stack engineer but depends on if I don't find frontend development boring. Also trying to learn other stuff like video editing, graphic design, psychology and sociology. That's all for now.
